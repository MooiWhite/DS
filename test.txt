Walking on a dream; how can I explain; Talking to myself; Will I see again? ;We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it; Always pushing up the ;hill, searching for the thrill of it; On and on and on we are calling out, out again; Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
